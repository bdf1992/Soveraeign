# Shared Contracts

Status: `PROPOSED · STACK-NEUTRAL`

These schemas compile the logical fields in `SPEC.md` into portable validation
surfaces. They constrain records crossing service and participant boundaries;
they do not prescribe storage tables, programming-language classes, transport,
or deployment topology.

| Contract | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `service-manifest.schema.json` | declares a service boundary, ownership, dependencies, operations, and forbidden shortcuts |
| `operation-plan.schema.json` | declares consequential work before execution |
| `receipt.schema.json` | records the terminal outcome of a crossing or transition |
| `participant-observation.schema.json` | carries implementation observations into the conformance oracle |

A schema-valid record can still be semantically unfit. Conformance fixtures and
independent observation remain necessary.
